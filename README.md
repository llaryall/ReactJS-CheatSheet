A comprehensive and interactive cheatsheet for ReactJS concepts, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PocketBase. This application provides a quick reference for React developers of all levels, from beginners to advanced users.

  - **Interactive UI:**
     - Collapsible category cards with smooth animations (Framer Motion).
     - Pagination within categories for different tiers of topics.
     - Clickable topics open a modal with detailed descriptions and code examples.
  - **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific topics across all categories.
  - **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  - **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
  - **Syntax Highlighting:** Code examples within topic descriptions are clearly highlighted.
  - **Static Export:** Optimized for static hosting platforms like Vercel, ensuring fast load times.
